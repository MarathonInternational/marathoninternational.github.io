          <p><em>Founder  &amp; CEO</em></p>
          <p>Chandramohan  Rainaak, Founder &amp; Managing Director of <strong>Marathon International</strong> holds  a master’s degree from United Kingdom. After his education like a normal aspirant,  he worked in UK, with his personal experience of going abroad and his exposure  he believes going abroad helped him to grow professionally. After gaining a professional  level of experience, he had two reasons to start <strong>Marathon International</strong> in the year 2012: first, he identified the need for families to have expert  comprehensive educational planning,whether they are staying in their hometown  or moving their children around the world. Secondly, he is passionate about  helping each student to realize their individual potential. With his excellent people skills and personalized counselling sessions, he knows how to identify and guide students to choose what is right  for them.<br />
            He knows a student’s future can be hugely influenced  – for good or for bad – by the educational decisions they and their parents  make along the way. When students are in the right college for them, they  thrive to succeed. When they are in the wrong environment, or lack the ability  to manage their current environment, life can be unnecessarily difficult.  Sometimes the consequences of not having their academic, social, or emotional  needs met can be quite serious. Therefore, before understanding what we do and  what makes us experts, it is probably even more important to understand WHY we  do it. Whether the young person lives down the street, across the country, or  in Mongolia, He is on a mission to help students grow and succeed!</p>
